# Task 13: PCA – Dimensionality Reduction

## Dataset
- Sklearn Digits Dataset (8x8 handwritten digits)

## Steps Performed
1. Loaded and flattened image data
2. Applied feature scaling using StandardScaler
3. Applied PCA with multiple components (2, 10, 30, 50)
4. Plotted cumulative explained variance
5. Reduced dimensionality using PCA
6. Trained Logistic Regression on original and reduced data
7. Compared accuracy
8. Visualized 2D PCA projection

## Results
- PCA significantly reduced feature size
- Small accuracy trade-off observed
- Demonstrates variance vs compression trade-off

## Tools
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
